queuePaste

Takes a txt file and parses it line by line, each of which is stored in the clipboard for 5 seconds which can then be used over that duration as a paste
prior to moving to the next line in file for copying/pasting usage.
#BUGS:  
#ERROR: Access Denied if paste is executed when it tries to copy to os.
